# Employee-Performance-and-Retention-Analysis

This project explores a real-world HR dataset to analyze employee performance and attrition trends using a combination of data science, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The core objective was to build predictive systems that help HR departments understand the key drivers behind employee retention and performance, enabling data-driven decision-making in workforce planning.

The implementation was carried out in **four structured phases**. In **Phase 1**, the employee dataset (`Employee_data.csv`) was loaded using Pandas, cleaned by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, and then thoroughly explored through descriptive statistics and visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Pair plots and heatmaps revealed relationships and correlations between variables, while boxplots helped spot outliers. We also applied basic **probability concepts**, used **Bayes’ Theorem** to compute attrition likelihood based on performance, and conducted **hypothesis testing** to compare performance scores across departments.

In **Phase 2**, the focus shifted to **predictive modeling**. After scaling numerical features and encoding categorical ones, we built a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict whether an employee is likely to leave. We evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. We also built a **Linear Regression model** to predict employee performance scores based on inputs like age, department, and salary, assessing its accuracy using R² and MSE.

**Phase 3** introduced **deep learning** using TensorFlow/Keras. We designed and trained two neural networks: one regression-based for predicting performance and another classification model to identify attrition risks. These models were built with fully connected layers using ReLU and sigmoid activations, and were trained with optimizers like Adam. The performance of each model was validated against test data to ensure reliability.

Finally, in **Phase 4**, we focused on deriving **insights and building reports**. We summarized key findings, such as departments with high attrition risk and features most correlated with low performance. We proposed actionable recommendations like customized retention strategies, engagement programs, and department-specific training. The results were visualized through interactive charts and graphs, and a detailed project report was compiled to provide a comprehensive overview of the methods, findings, and recommendations.

The full project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, and interactive visualizations are integrated into a **Streamlit dashboard**, which runs locally on `localhost:8501`. This makes the analysis easy to present and interact with. All code, visualizations, and results are available in this GitHub repository for educational and professional reference.
